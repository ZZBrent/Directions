# Directions
A short python script that opens Google Maps to the address last copied or using command line arguments.

If you simply want to use the clipboard feature feel free to download and use the Program folder and run the excutable whenver you have an address copied that you want to look up.  However, if you want more flexibility, feel free to runthe PYthon program and input each address as an argument separating them with a semi-colon and a space (ex: New York, New York; Los Angeles, California).

As usual feel free to contact me if you have any additional ideas on how to make this better through extra functionality, or if you run into any problems using it.
